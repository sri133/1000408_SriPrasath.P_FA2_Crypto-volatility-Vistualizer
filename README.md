🚀 Crypto Volatility Visualizer Pro
📌 Project Overview

Crypto Volatility Visualizer Pro is an interactive financial dashboard built using Python and Streamlit that helps users explore and understand cryptocurrency price volatility through real market data, mathematical simulations, and AI-powered analytics.

This project connects mathematical modeling, financial datasets, and interactive visualization to simulate how cryptocurrency prices behave under different volatility conditions. Users can experiment with wave patterns, adjust market parameters, analyze real crypto data, and explore advanced trading analytics in a single dashboard.

The project was developed as part of the Mathematics for AI coursework and demonstrates skills in data preparation, visualization, dashboard development, and cloud deployment.
